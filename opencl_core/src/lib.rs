//! Thin wrappers for the `OpenCL` FFI functions and types.
//!
//! *The layer between the hard rough and the soft furry parts...*
//!
//! Allows access to `OpenCL` FFI functions with a minimal layer of abstraction,
//! providing both safety and convenience. Using functions in this module is
//! only recommended for use when functionality has not yet been implemented
//! on the 'standard' ocl interfaces. The 'core' and 'standard' interfaces are
//! all completely interoperable, and generally feature-equivalent.
//!
//!
//! ## Even Lower Level: [`cl_h`]
//!
//! If there's still something missing or for some reason you need direct FFI
//! access, use the functions in the [`cl_h`] module. The pointers used by
//! [`cl_h`] functions can be wrapped in [`opencl_core`] wrappers (opencl_core::PlatformId,
//! opencl_core::Context, etc.) and passed to [`opencl_core`] module functions. Likewise the
//! other way around (using, for example: [`EventRaw::as_ptr`]).
//!
//!
//! ## Performance
//!
//! Performance between all three interface layers, [`cl_h`], [`opencl_core`], and
//! the 'standard' types, is identical or virtually identical (if not, please
//! file an issue).
//!
//!
//! ## Safety
//!
//! At the time of writing, some functions still *may* break Rust's usual
//! safety promises and have not been 100% comprehensively evaluated and
//! tested. Please file an [issue] if you discover something!
//!
//!
//! ## Length vs Size
//!
//! No, not that...
//!
//! Quantifiers passed to functions in the `OpenCL` API are generally expressed
//! in terms of bytes where units passed to functions in this module are
//! expected to be `bytes / sizeof(T)`, corresponding with units returned by
//! the ubiquitous `.len()` method. The suffix '_size' or '_bytes' is
//! generally used when a parameter deviates from this convention.
//!
//!
//! ## More Documentation
//!
//! As most of the functions here are minimally documented, please refer to
//! the official `OpenCL` documentation linked below. Although there isn't a
//! precise 1:1 parameter mapping between the `opencl_core` and original functions,
//! it's close enough (modulo the size/len difference discussed above) to help
//! sort out any questions you may have until a more thorough documentation
//! pass can be made. View the source code in [`src/core/functions.rs`] for
//! more mapping details.
//!
//! [`OpenCL` 1.2 SDK Reference:
//! https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.2/docs/man/xhtml/]
//!
//!
//! ## Help Wanted
//!
//! Please help complete coverage of any FFI functions you may need by filing
//! an [issue](https://github.com/cogciprocate/ocl/issues) or creating a [pull
//! request](https://github.com/cogciprocate/ocl/pulls).
//!
//! [STATUS]: <br/> Coverage of core stuff: 100%. <br/> Coverage of peripheral
//! stuff: 90%. <br/>
//!
//!
//! ## `opencl_core` Stands Alone
//!
//! This module may eventually be moved to its own separate crate (with its
//! dependencies `cl_h` and `error`).
