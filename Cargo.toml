# Enabling this feature causes all `Future::poll` functions to behave in a
# thread-blocking manner, causing the calling thread to block then return
# `Async::Ready(..)` instead of behaving as a normal future would (returning
# either `Async::Ready(..)` or `Async::NotReady` depending on the situation).
#
# Enabling this feature will reduce performance. Do this only if your
# (platform) drivers have issues/bugs with event callbacks or thread
# synchronization (old/non-compliant drivers - Known cases: certain
# pre-Sandy-Bridge Intel processors [on Intel drivers], some other
# pre-gen-5-core processors [on Intel drivers]).
#
# Leaving this disabled is recommended.
