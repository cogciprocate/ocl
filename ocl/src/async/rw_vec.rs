/// A locking `Vec` which interoperates with OpenCL events and Rust futures to
/// provide exclusive access to data.
///
/// Calling `::read` or `::write` returns a future which will resolve into a
/// `RwGuard`.
///
/// ## Platform Compatibility
///
/// Some CPU device/platform combinations have synchronization problems when
/// accessing an `RwVec` from multiple threads. Known platforms with problems
/// are 2nd and 4th gen Intel Core processors (Sandy Bridge and Haswell) with
/// Intel OpenCL CPU drivers. Others may be likewise affected. Run the
/// `device_check.rs` example to determine if your device/platform is
/// affected. AMD platform drivers are known to work properly on the
/// aforementioned CPUs so use those instead if possible.
