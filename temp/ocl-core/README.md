For a higher level, easier to use, and far less verbose OpenCL interface (that
compiles to virtually the same thing) see the
[ocl](https://github.com/cogciprocate/ocl) crate. The [`trivial.rs`
example](https://github.com/cogciprocate/ocl/blob/master/ocl/examples/trivial.rs)
gives a rough idea of of the equivalence between the two.

If you have need of any unimplemented functionality [please file an
issue](https://github.com/cogciprocate/ocl/issues) and request it.
